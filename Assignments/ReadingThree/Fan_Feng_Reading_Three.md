Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web is a very interesting interview about the internet and artificial intelligence technology. This interview reminds me some from Marx’s Capital, and it even involved to theology. In the beginning of this interview, Clara Herrmann and Sebastian Schmieg talk about the case of Fiverr, this case very shows the world is changed by the development of internet technology.  People usually think worker in the factory is a lower level job, they are repeating the same work again and again like Charles Chaplin in the Modern Times or the iPhone assembler in Foxconn.  In the side, people think Artist or Designer is a high level. Even them may not have very high income, but they are working with their Creative. Fiverr is changing what people think about. Most artists and designers are offering their service at a very lower price, it means they are using some repeatable templates again and again. It is like the labor of art and design, the worker working in front of the computer. This system already existed in the world for a long time, like the designer in a sign shop, most interior designer, and the animator, but Fiverr show how many people and position are working whit this system. Schmieg think AIs will produce art even they aren’t artist, it means the artist and designer who work whit these replaceable contents will very easily be replaced by AI, and it is already happening in some industry, it is like factory worker replaced by the automatic production line.

AIs need develop to replace artist and design, human labor is still necessary before the AIs developed and doing everything. In the interview, they talk about the different social media let users to identic the images to help their improver the image identification ability, this also involve some issues about the users’ labor value got exploit. But I think this just the cost for us to use these “free” services. There are also some other cases about human labor work for AI’s in our everyday life. There are lot’s different driving apps appear to the market like the Uber, Deliveroo or Postmat, this app can give people convenient services like pick up people, delivery food, and package. All of these services are operated by human drivers, but all this assignment for drivers are manage by AIs.  People are talking about these types of app assigning jobs are helping the company save the cost of the employee, and it exploits the drivers. How every, the drivers still driving for Uber or other company is because the AIs can’t drive right. Even we already see a lot of Google self-driving cars on the streets of Mountain View, people still not trust the safety of these cars, the automobile industry only uses it for assist driving. When the AIs can drive for us, the driver will lose their job. It is like many artist and design on Fiverr will lose their job when AI can produce art.

Different internet companies are developing their own AIs, and what their AIs more powerful than other companies. Their user also helps develop the AIs in their everyday use, more time they are using the services, the AIs will become more powerful.  In the other hand, the AIs we are using right now are very mechanical and always doing things in an efficient way. many programmer and artist want to make the AIs more humanity and more understand human, at least the AIs will act like a human. People want a humanity AI to assist them more human, it may be because humanly is afraid to something nonhuman, or it may be because it will make people feel comfortable. Finally, human will create a powerful and human being and handle everything for us. Is this very similar to someone or something we were known?
