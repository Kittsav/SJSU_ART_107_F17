This by far was my favorite reading so far, I found myself getting so enthralled by this perspective I would've never have.
I never thought about my digital labor, or even thought what I was doing on the internet could be considered labor.
Sebastian Schmieg perfectly illustrated this new perspective for me. I actually took the time to watch his project, "
I Will Say Whatever You Want In Front of a Pizza" and was so amazed. Donald Trump having a teenager make a prezi, there
is something that sounds off about that statement. I didn't know if it was because its unprofessional? Not necessarily,
or was it because it showed he was lazy? No, not that either, then I read the teenager didn't know who he was, and had
felt guilt after for helping him win. When I read that, I got it. I got what Sebastian was trying to introduce with 
his piece. I was honestly take aback from how in my face his point was and how did I never see it. That yes, in a big
way we are apart of creation and programming advance technologies that may very well be used to replace us someday.
The thought that we will might be replaced by AI at first was disconcerning, especially as an aritst I often find myself
obsessed with myself for being better than others or atleast different in a particular human thing to do. If an AI could
one day do what I do, and I taught it how wihtout ever knowing, theres some sort of loss felt there. It felt almost
like I was being used for something I didn't think I was agreeing to, when I thought as my use of tech as digital labor.
Yet, once I got over myself I found myself actually wonderous and excited that maybe one day, I can come back as an AI.
If we are able to recreate my brain trully, and if I believe thats where connscience and my art come from, then perhaps 
this is a good thing for a conceeded artist such as myself. Jokes aside, I really do feel hopeful and optimistic about 
our future relationship with AI, but I do think that will be determined to our perspective on it as we are in the ealry 
developmental stages, and those perspectives are so gretaly represented with art. Like the artist says, if AI never gets
better than that's okay too.
