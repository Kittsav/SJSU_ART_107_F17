# READING THREE RESPONSE

This reading introduced me to a lot of terms and ideas that I never heard or read about before. This is the first time I read about a person, who’s job is to pretend to be a bot for a company. This interview opens a very interesting overview of possible future jobs and AI. I never really thought about software as an extension of the body, senses, or cognition. I always regard it as a kind of product designed by people proficient in computer science when there could be some interactivity between the customer and the app but never up to the point where the activity could be considered a form of labor. I found the examples like Uber very intriguing. People who work for Uber is an extension of the Uber app because Uber itself does not offer anything but a software for connecting the driver to the customer as well as a pay system. The diver has to provide the vehicle, the fuel, the device, the maintenance, and other services. Uber drives are an extension of the software through their body, their senses, and their cognition.  

Towards the end portion of the interview there was a question about whether or not can machines and bots be artist. Schmieg stated that they cannot be artist because they just follow a set of rules or certain trained behavior. At the moment I agree with his statement but I am not so sure in the near future. There are many art producing Ai today such as AVIA, an AI who is capable of producing emotional soundtrack music. I have listened to a few tracks and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. The music was more in the genre of classical music. The album was called “Genesis.” If the program can produce music this good I cannot imagine what it would do to other genres like pop, rock, jazz, tec. I am interested in knowing how long does it take to write one musical piece. Is it years, months, weeks, days or minutes and seconds. I guess the next step is to possibly create a virtual conductor to direct the performance for a show. Another example is The Painting Fool, created by Simon Colton, the ERA Chair in Digital Game Technology at Falmouth University, a AI that can create portraits based on its mood. The website http://www.thepaintingfool.com/index.html is funny because its written in the perspective of the program as if it was a human. As one would expect this program is not recognized as an artist by others in the respected field. One of Colton’s goal is to overcome that obstacle. I think this will change when we are risky enough to take the leap of fate and allow AIs to have a conscious and be self-aware. For bad or for worse I think it will be inevitable.
