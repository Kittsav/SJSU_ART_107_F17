The title of this reading reminds me the caption of Peter Steiner’ cartoon “On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog”, and Marisa Olson also mention this cartoon.  I was confusing why Olson uses the word “Doghouse”. This is a reading about postinternet, and Olson was focusing on the relationship between online and offline. In the 1990s when internet open to the public, most of the internet was only present on the internet. At that time, the internet was still a very new term for people. Even Peter Steiner didn’t interest on the internet when he draws the cartoon. Internet was the new world and uncharted areas at that time, it provides a brand new platform for artists to create art and ignore any red tape from the real work. Many people thought the internet and the real world are two separate worlds. Over a decade later, the internet already become a very common thing in people’s everyday life, people even not use the word “surfing” anymore.   We can see the small businesses like restaurant put the social media stickers on their front desk and the ask the customers to follow, we can see people ask their cellphone any question like how to go somewhere. The huge developed of processing power on mobile devices helps the internet extend. The Internet is not only some web page behind the computer screen, many different things are connecting to the internet, such as a light bulb, a locker, a camera, cat collars. The world “postinternet” looks like it is at the end of the internet era, but that's not true.  I think “postinternet” is about this generation the internet extends to everybody’s lives.

It is a very big change after internet extended from the computer screen, China is a very good example. I used to think there is a lot of internet users in China when I still surf the internet in front of the computer screen. After the cheap smartphone popularizes, the number of internet users incase geometrically. Everybody is using internet, even a beggar is using the electronic wallet to collect alms. The demand of entertainment contents also increases, even some roughly contents are attracting people’s attention. Internet art used to make and present art on the internet, it is very curious at the dawn of the internet. The Internet already become a common element in people’s lives like air and water, it is not a curious thing, and it already extends. Internet art can go back to the real world. Internet art can be some work display in the gallery space be relate to internet, or it can be a work use internet to control something in the real work.
