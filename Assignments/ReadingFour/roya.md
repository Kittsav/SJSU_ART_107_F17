The writer starts the article by introducing the term “Post internet cities/architecture”
As she claimed she was the person who came up with the term over a decade ago, she referred to it in her art practice as a combination of online and offline concepts.
As a person who worked for Rhizome, she wanted to promote internet based arts which could work either online or offline.

She mentioned one aspect of the post internet movement is its own social context, while the spirit of the post internet movement is the idea that information wants to be free and easily spread. We all understand the aesthetic and concept of the internet as we are consumers of internet. But what makes it complicated is that new media artists deal with internet as a medium of their work while people have to interpret and understand it.
To the best of my understanding she aimed to let us know the blending and hazy distinction of offline and online is the essence of the post internet time, not just net art. As she mentioned how yelp stickers, offline google map or even Facebook are both offline/online aspects of the internet in everyday life.

Based on my understanding and how I relate this article to those I previously read, the author talked about the network culture and how we are impacted by it by being unable to be unplugged. She used “post internet” to describe a critical attitude towards the way the internet and technology affect us. For example, there is a great deal of access to information and the ability to connect with everyone maybe by referring to “transparency” but on the other hand there is more surveillance and invasion of privacy.

It seems the writer also wants to point that being in post internet era also has its own negative impact on human life as well. The Internet and technology has been growing but it has its own weaknesses. As it develops there are tons of errors, failures and rejections coming to existence as well. Moreover, there will come to a moment that machines will challenge our knowledge or even our emotion. In addition, now we have both offline/online spaces and its more difficult to find the line between what is private and what is public. She says sometimes there can be private acts in public spaces or public records of the private information. This makes the concept of the privacy more challenging that it was before.

At the end, she brought some examples to emphasize the relation between virtual life and reality. Like she mentioned smart devices will trick us into going outside. It reminded me of Pokémon Go as an example of this kind of mixed reality. In other examples, she mentioned the relation between windows in a room to windows on a computer screen or how mass production is like a form of copy pasting. These are all examples of online and offline sides of the post internet time, and all about how now and in near future smart devices will continue impact of our lifestyles. She  wonders if they will isolate us more than connect us.
