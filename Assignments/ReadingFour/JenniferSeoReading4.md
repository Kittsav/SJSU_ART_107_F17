There was a lot of repetition of certain words in this article by Marisa Olson and it more than a few skims to make sense of most of it.  But essentially I think what she is trying to describe is that sort of evolution from where the internet first started as simple web pages to some sort of connection to real life.  We pretty much rely on all the services that are available on the internet now an we could not live without them even if we tried.  Anyway, I think Olson understated this as the internet is increasingly integrating itself into more practical things like turning on light bulbs over wifi, or even fetching a page on your refrigerator.  

Then there is this concept of cybertotalism which pretty describes what I had just described.  But the author is also expressing her concern that we think technology will solve all our problems.  She is right to be concerned because of the fact that we take this for granted and when some new gadget comes out , we are fallaciously under the impression that this new device is going to make everything so much better even though it’s just the same thing but faster.

The last thing that I resonated with is this concept of an internet community which I’ve often heard media artists talk about.  It is truly astounding how this relationship to real life can actually create some invisible city like scape.
