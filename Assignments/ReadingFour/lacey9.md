The idea of postinternet art to me has been brewing since the dawn of AOL. From AOL the internet started seeping into all of our lives for better or worse. The voice saying, “you got mail” rang in your head whenever a letter came in the mail. Spending hours editing your aim profile and icon. Deciding what font you had to have. That’s when the internet starting is pavlovian training on all of us. The dinging noise of receiving an aim you catch your attention from across the room and draw you back to the computer screen.  That’s why it’s no surprise to me that the postinertnet culture has been leaking into the art world, since it is now such a big part of our life. A lot of us try to unplug and get away, but we’ve become so addicted that its almost nearly impossible to go half a day without looking at anything connected. Even our televisions are connected now. Being able to use voice recognition so that you can easily access your favorite shows. 
	Any way you look at it you can argue this is good or bad. That we are all more connected to one another and that we have all the information at our fingertips. But at the same time many people sit on their computers on social media shut in their homes, and never actually go out and be social. Many of us are losing our roots with the natural world around us and almost are forgetting how to survive without technology. 

More to come….
