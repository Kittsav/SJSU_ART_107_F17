  While reading the article and viewing the film, I began to think about how the dogs and the machines feel like they're me, 
but they don't at the same time. Wondering if I seek to understand like the dog appears to when it stares at the traffic 
passing, immediately the film offset me with the word "misunderstood" printed in black with a white backdrop as it stood to prove 
that I did not understand what it was like to be a dog. Yet I kept beleiving that I did. I kept thinking, "oh my gosh, he 
is sitting beause the dog is aware and understands english. Yet again, it didn't take long for me to hypothesis that perhaps the dog didn't
understand that commands the way I did. For me it is apart of my native language but for the dog, perhaps its a noise that means lay down for 
food. This might have been the point Jesse Mclean was trying to make with the clips and cuts of different forms of AI. He was
saying that you will never know or understand what it is to not be human. In admitting that fact, in some way you now undertsand what it's
like ot be a Dog or an Computer, you know that it isn't to be human. That there are other valid ways to experience the world around us at no 
no lesser or greater value then our own. 

  Observing the themes, I got that the film feels to be designed as a stimulant, as the traffic recordings are interesting and loud. The 
  visuals are very animated and all pull high contrast when either a cutscene with colors on a black backdrop, or black text
  on a white backdrop. They are all very loud and seemingly random, yet I found a pattern, I found a equality amoungst the three 
  subjects of humans, dogs, and computers. I discovered cutscenes in an order of random repitition. Did the dog see it the same way?
  Would a computer make sense of it or call for what it is at the surface. Surely we as humans see deeper than the surface right?
  The Film seems to disagree. The Interview highlights that there is often a skin on vital parts of the content whether it'd be 
  fingerprints on the monitor screen or a screen door in front of the dog. This skin is like a container for the different worlds
  each experiences it. This lead to questionings of reality and how we persieve it to be true. In our cultural skin we can lack the 
  undertsanding of others. Others that may even live in our houses at pets. The Dog has a relaity unlike but sourced from our own. 
  The Computer just the same, so why is the computer worth any less of life then our perception of it? Is it because of fear? 
  Given the Computer or Dog generate intelligence in our terms, where then does that put us on the food chain? Misunderstood perhaps.
