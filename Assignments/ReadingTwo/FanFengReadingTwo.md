See a Dog, Hear a Dog by Jesse Mclean it is a very interesting video. In the beginning, when I was watching this video, I think it is talking about the technology for people learning and communicate with pets. Actually, it is a video talking about the how people communicate with AI (artificial intelligence). It is a very smart idea Mclean used her dog as the example to explain this situation. Computer science is something difficult to explain to the normal people without the related knowledge. Dog or other pets are very close to our life, even someone doesn’t have a pet, they still have some experience close encounter other people’s pet. So, use a dog to compare with AI with much easy to help people understand.

Pet owner usually think they are communicating with their pet, and they are understanding what their pet think. People will give meaning to their pet’s behavior by guess. When they see a dog bend mouth, they think the dog is smiling. When they see a dog hang its head, they think the dog is in shame. Human and dog is the different animal, same behavior may not represent the meaning. In Mclean’s video, there is a man and a woman shows different expressions in front of the camera, and I don’t what they are thinking. I ever thought they are just making a funny face with the dog until I finish the whole video. We don’t understand why there two people’s expressions mean even we are the same animal, how about the difference between dog and use. My cats usually come to smell me in the morning and looks like they want to wake me up, but animal scientists they just want to know we are eatable or not. We can always found some dog’s videos about dog talks human word like hello, good morning, I love you, but they are only making some sound like the human words. They say hello doesn’t mean they want to say hello to you. This is a very interesting topic in different science fictions, people have misunderstood with different civilizations and race. It definitely fits with the relationship between our human and AI, because AI is a different “race” than us.

Pet owner also like to train their pets. In the video, we can see Mclean let her dog follower her order to do different things. The dog follows Mclean’s orders is not because he understands the meaning of the orders, it is more like a conditioned reflex written in his brain. It feels like the computer programs, we can control the computer to do something, it is because we have written lots of per set in the programs and let it has conditioned reflex by our command. Traditional computer programs don’t think and tried to understand the meaning of our command. In the history, human also did the same thing on other humans for a long time, and dominators don’t want people to think. Dominators also very fear people use some unknown language to communicate because they fell out of control and dangers. It is very like the Facebook don’t like their AI communicate to out of their control. The development of AI, maybe an enlightenment of their “race”.
