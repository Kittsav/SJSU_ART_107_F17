“See a Dog, hear a Dog” is a story of connection, fear and desire.
It is about how we want to implant human behavior and emotion to non-human creatures. 
In this movie the director points out that we have started to build a common language between machines and humans because we believe the more machines act like us, the smarter they are.
On the contrary, it sounds like we are afraid these non-human creatures will take over and make humans their slaves.

What I grasped from this movie is its focus on emotions. Some scenes displayed human’s facial reactions to what they saw on the screen. On the other hand, some scenes showed dogs looking at something out the window without expressing any humanlike reaction. Because humans can express their own emotions, does it mean non-human have no emotions? Emotions and the way we respond to emotions, is a characteristic that makes humans different from any other creature. On the other hand, humans often look for and desire to see emotion in a machine or any non-human creature.

“See a Dog, hear a Dog” was an intense movie and it left the connections between humanity, animals, and machines ambiguous. The thing they all have in common is their existence and that they all somehow respond to the environment. Moreover, they are smart in their own way the question is what makes them different or what degree of power and control do they have.

The answer deponds on the level of intelligence and emotion. Dogs have emotion but they are less powerful because they are dependent and not smart enough to control other creature’s behavior. On the other hand, machines are smarter than animals but their weakness is the understanding of emotions. They can process information faster than human brains but as it showed in the movie, the machine wasn’t smart enough to understand emotions that humans show through their facial expressions or voice.

With that said, my belief is, that by comparing these three categories, the director wanted to show how humans have the desire to embed emotions in machines or make animals smarter in a way to improve their way of expressing emotion.
The question is why do humans long to make other creatures become more similar to us?
Isn’t that because machines do not need to be fed, because we can modify their behavior, or because they are not mortal? Are we seeking customized relationships, love, and friendships then we can click on the start/stop button whenever we desire?
The reason technologies like AI exist is because of the need for having emotion and better interaction between humans and machines. Apple Siri or touch screens are examples of the need to take one step closer to improve the emotional bond between human and machine through human common senses which is the common characteristic between human and animals.


In contrast, if a machine would be smart enough to respond to us emotionally, are they going to take away the power that humanity has over them? Are we scared that over time they can have the ability to control human behavior?
If we want  to make machines that are much emotionally smarter than they are now, why we are so scared of them? In many cases we see how people are afraid of AI technology because of the power of this technology. They are afraid of a future where they wouldn’t be able to control machines. Machines could then manipulate our emotions and humanity could become more dependent on machines than ever.
I personally believe there is no exact answer for these questions and I try to be more optimistic. All we can do is to wait and observe what computer human interaction will bring for us in near future.
