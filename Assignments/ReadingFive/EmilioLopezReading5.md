How democratic is the internet in post-internet art education? My personal response can be summarized in the answer: somewhat.
I find that many times the internet tries to offer free or low cost services for teaching post-internet art methods, for example
youtube is host to many post-internet art educators, yet there then arises the issue with many of these youtube educators, and that 
is money. How is it paid for, an ad in the beginning of the video perhaps, or even a link to a patreon account where the premise
is donations keep the educator's content up and some even have direct partnerships with larger advertising companies, if not work 
for them, like videos form adobe or apple on their own software/hardware. For the most part, small amateur educators rely on ads.
This means they meet someone's requirements, which to me isn't very democratic when I can't give live feedback in ther first place. It
would also seem most creators that depend on donations to educate the masses, often have a hard time reaching an audiance large enough 
to sustain quality content so for most, ads are the way to go when it comes to creating educational content for free or cheap. Which it kind of needs to be in order for the masses to reach it.
So my extended answer would be, yes, the internet is democratic in its plethora of post-internet art education, but the democratic process
online is a slow one as its dragged down by bureaucracy.

Ross Chapman actually seems to agree with a lot of my initial points, he talks about a point I didn't which is how the internet 
allows people that have similar interets to lobby and create content amongst each other, and that allows everyone to have a voice unless 
environment is limiting such as a google docs paper like this one for instance. The content is crowd sourced and original, but 
there are rules about what andd what not to post. Part of having a fully demorcraitic platform is that you open the doors to trolls.
I'm not convinced trolls halt the democratic process of creating post-internet art education centers, but I do believe a part in 
hindering the creations of a rigid online learning plan. 

Raphael Vella talks about the illusion of the rules and platforms I touched on above, essentially that art is a natural part of the internet 
and so the content that drives the internet is made up of people, and poeple that are tryign to gain an audience. I still think the 
wall of bureaucracy is there, but I agree with Vella that this makes the internet have more meaning. I think this leads to power for educators on 
the web. Like Vella was mentioning, the internet is a constant, it never stops growing, and with this, some branches grow larger and 
influenece other bracnhes, to gain this mass it needs eyes, and so the internt is democratic in nature. It is drivien by where we 
choose to look, that is our immediate feedback.

Finally Estrella Luna Mu√±oz takes the optimistic approach I go with too. Many creators on youtube right now are having a hard 
time figuring out youtube's demonitization methods and are trying to find an alternative platform to keep producing the content.
Although bureaucracy is inevitable, so is art and art education on the internet today. Thus bureaucracy often times may loose to 
the louder voices of the people and their eduators. The bottom line is the internet, excluding the or not excluidng the dark web, is 
democratic in nature that anyone can post any thing and many platforms try to curate this, and many platforms are successful in 
curating and controlling parts of the web, but for better or worse, ultimatelly it is an uncontrollable thing. What our contribution to 
it menas the influence of other parts, and so the benefiets or drawback are dependent in us, isn't that what a democratic 
internet is about?
