For this reading, I had read different responses from 3 different professors:  Timothy Smith, Shelley Hannigan and Ross Chapman. Each of these professors teaches different areas, so truly they each have different views of post-internet art education. 

I will first talk about my own idea, since I am a student, I view current generation a lot different than my professors, simply in the fact that I use so much technology to create my artwork. However, I do disagree that internet is democratic. For many places on the web, many cannot enter or does not understand how to enter because there is a "password" preventing them from entering. It really isn't "for the people" if not everyone can use the same place with same interest. 

For the professors, Timothy Smith seem to wish for a more democratic approach to teaching rather than a strict follow the process kind. He expresses that current contemporary is shifting ever so slightly, so it is hard for professor to teach it in a format, but it is also hard for people to understand it when it is so against their culture. It doesn’t seem democratic to make everyone learn in the same way when some are more advance in certain things than others. Everyone learn differently, especially in current culture where most information is available online, some may absorb it differently than others, and professors should accept that possibility. 

Shelley Hannigan from her response seem like a hands-on professor. She feels as if internet is her total workload, where her total attention is focused onto the internet rather than creating work hands-on. She enjoys the physical aspect of creating objects rather than digital works. It is as if the internet prevents the younger people from making things and developing the skills and technique that would be of use to them in the future. The overload of technology on the internet has caused her to be obsessed with working online, but it is also something she doesn’t want to depend on. This professor suffers on the middle point of being fully technical, but yet relies onto the technical to reach out to her peers and students. 

Ross Chapman is a music professor and a musician. his views directly push into the idea of an artist and what makes an artist a digital artist. His idea of democracy in internet. It is like a gathering of likeminded people that are creating art in similar style because of the same echo chamber they have been in. Art professor cannot teach the same way in person and/or online, and it is hard to express certain ideals when some may just be focused on one part. The student's progress might suddenly change to mainstream, or that their progress might be stalled easily. Even when students have extraordinary technology and technique to create works that is unlike previous generation, they aren’t creating work in the aspect of creating art, but for a reward system from their peers.
