SociaGotcha is a collaborative project that works as a commentary on social media presence and interactions. In the world of today, it’s almost impossible to not have an online presence.

The point of the game is to add as many followers as possible. The number of followers directly correlates to how much “currency” you get in game.  You can then spend this in-game currency to affect your virtual pet’s overall status and well being. When you start, you are assigned a unique ID code. Add followers by interacting with other people in the gallery and obtaining their unique code. There are three different buttons that accomplish different things - eat, sleep, and play.  Keep your virtual pet alive as long as you can! Click below to play!
