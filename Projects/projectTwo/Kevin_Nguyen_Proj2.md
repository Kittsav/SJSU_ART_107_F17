Word of caution, might wanna lower the audio a little bit.

Artist Statement:
Recently i've been feeling like i've been going through a loop. By this I mean every day and every night I would end up looking at my phone and checking out social media. As days go by, I feel like I'm stuck in a routine. This is where my project comes in. It creates a dialog where the user would be stuck in a black and white world which is a metaphor to the world that we currently live in.

when you click on the portal icon on the desk, you'll be transported to the "wonder world of oz" which is a huge parody of Social Media life and how much of a junk place it is. The more time you spend in there, the more "fake" happiness you would feel from the environment. There's a lot of things going on but each object has a metaphorical representation.

The Witch represents collective social media users spewing out non-sense, spam, or negativity. The ads videos playing everywhere is a commentary of ads thats present. It also shows how ad and monetization works. The gate in front of you leads you to "the truth". You can interprete it anyway you like but from how I see it, it is a metaphor for truly understanding how trapped we are in terms of having these "gateway to oz" (Phones). Lastly the portal to the right in the Oz world leads back to home. This is where you can repeat the cycle again.

Overall this project is a huge metaphor of how: We live in a grey boring world, but once we get in bed and start browsing through our phone, we'd be at piece at the "fake disney" type happiness. I don't hate social media, but I have hate what it's starting to become and how others are taking and misuing it.
