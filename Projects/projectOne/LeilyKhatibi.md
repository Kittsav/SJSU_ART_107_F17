## Inspiration:

Growing up in Iran, I was constantly exposed to traditional Persian paintings called 'Miniatures' and symmetrical patterns in Islamic ornamentation found on material artifacts. My connection with these old-fashion forms of the visual arts drives my art practice.  

### - Persian Poem [ Leily & Majnun ]

My name (Leily) is one of the most common names in Iran. Leily is the Persian 'Juliet', the greatest lover of all time in my homeland's literature. Centuries before Romeo and Juliet, Leily and Majnun shaped an ancient tragic love story, where they were not allowed to be together since their tribes being in conflict.

### - Love Today

We live in â€œa world that has been reformulated by the digital moment. This makes me wonder how love has evolved in our time compared to Leily and Majnun's love in ancient times. It's a certain fact that social media has changed the ways we communicate with people. From my point of view, people have become so obsessed with the image they create of themselves online that true love has lost it's image.

### - Cyber Narcissism

As an "ex-Instagram-influencer" I admit that I easily let the numbers of my likes and followers define me. At desperate times, it can even feel like I am living in a screen wishing that people would value me. The more views, likes and followers I have, I feel more self-worth. Being a "Leily", I have been expected all my life to live up to the name, yet I feel my love story is more of an online tragic self-love story.

This net art project is a contemporary representation of an old Miniature painting. The top 3 buttons are 'Like', 'Follow' and 'Share' opposed to the ones on the bottom being 'Unfollow', 'Block' and 'Report As Spam'. Depending on which button has been clicked, the avatar's face turns happy or sad. Making this project for me was a way to visualize how seeking attention or needing admiration from others online extends farther than screens and affects us in real life.
